<h2 class="adsimple-221107369">TLS encryption with https</h2>

By using TLS (Transport Layer Security), an encryption protocol for secure data transmission over the Internet, we can ensure the protection of confidential data. You acknowledge the use of this safeguarding of the data transfer at the small lock symbol in the upper left corner of the browser and the use of the scheme https (instead of http) as part of our Internet address.</p>
<h2 class="adsimple-221107369">Cookies</h2>
<p>Our website uses HTTP cookies to store user-specific data.<br/>
Below, we explain what cookies are and why they are used to help you better understand the following privacy statement.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-221107369">What exactly are cookies?</h3>
<p>Whenever you surf the Internet, you use a browser. Well-known browsers include Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Microsoft Edge. Most web pages store small text files in your browser. These files are called cookies.</p>
<p>One thing can not be dismissed: cookies are really useful helpers. Almost all websites use cookies. More precisely, they are HTTP cookies, as there are other cookies for other applications. HTTP cookies are small files that are stored by our website on your computer. These cookie files are automatically stored in the cookie folder, the "brain" of your browser. A cookie consists of a name and a value. When defining a cookie, one or more attributes must also be specified.</p>
<p>Cookies store certain user data about you, such as language or personal page settings. When you return to our site, your browser will return the "user-related" information to our site. Thanks to the cookies, our website knows who you are and gives you the attitude you are used to. In some browsers, each cookie has its own file; in others, such as Firefox, all cookies are stored in a single file.
There are both first-party cookies and third-party cookies. First-party cookies are created directly from our site, and third-party cookies are created by partner websites (e.g. Google Analytics). Each cookie is to be evaluated individually, since each cookie stores different data. The expiry time of a cookie also varies from a few minutes to a few years. Cookies are not software programs and do not contain viruses, Trojans or other "pests". Cookies also can not access information from your PC.</p>
<p>For example, cookie data may look like this:</p>
<strong class="adsimple-221107369">Name:</strong> _ga<br />
<strong class="adsimple-221107369">Value:</strong> GA1.2.1326744211.152221107369
<strong class="adsimple-221107369">Purpose:</strong> distinguishment of website visitors<br />
<strong class="adsimple-221107369">Expiration date:</strong> after 2 years</p>
<p>These minimum sizes should be able to support a browser:</p>
<ul>
<li>At least 4096 bytes per cookie</li>
<li>At least 50 cookies per domain</li>
<li>At least 3000 cookies in total</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="adsimple-221107369">What types of cookies are there?</h3>
<p>The question of which cookies we use in particular depends on the services used and will be clarified in the following sections of the privacy policy. At this point we would like to briefly discuss the different types of HTTP cookies.</p>
<p>There are 4 types of cookies:</p>
<p>
<strong class="adsimple-221107369">Essential cookies</br/>
</strong>These cookies are necessary to ensure basic functionality of the website. For example, these cookies are needed if a user puts a product in the shopping cart, then continues surfing on other sites and later goes to the checkout. These cookies do not delete the shopping cart, even if the user closes his browser window.</p>
<p>
<strong class="adsimple-221107369">Appropriate cookies
</strong>
These cookies collect information about the user behavior and whether the user gets any error messages. In addition, these cookies are also used to measure the load time and behavior of the website on different browsers.</p>
<p>
<strong class="adsimple-221107369">Targeted cookies
</strong>
These cookies make for better usability. For example, stored locations, font sizes or form data are stored.</p>
<p>
<strong class="adsimple-221107369">Advertising cookies
</strong>
These cookies are also called targeting cookies. They are used to provide the user with customized advertising. This can be very convenient, but also very annoying.
</p>
<p>Usually, the first time you visit a webpage, you are asked which of these cookie types you want to allow. And of course, this decision is also stored in a cookie.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-221107369">How can I delete cookies?</h3>
<p>You decide for yourself how and whether you want to use cookies. Regardless of which service or which website the cookies come from, you always have the option of deleting, deactivating or only partially allowing cookies. For example, you may block third-party cookies but allow all other cookies.</p>
<p>If you want to know which cookies have been saved in your browser, if you want to change or delete cookie settings, you can find this in your browser settings:</p>
<a class="adsimple-221107369" href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?tid=221107369" class="external" rel="nofollow">Chrome: Delete, activate, and manage cookies in Chrome</a>
<a class="adsimple-221107369" href="https://support.apple.com/de-at/guide/safari/sfri11471/mac?tid=221107369" class="external" rel="nofollow">Safari: Manage cookies and site data with Safari</a>
<a class="adsimple-221107369" href="https://support.mozilla.org/de/kb/cookies-und-website-daten-in-firefox-loschen?tid=221107369" class="external" rel="nofollow">Firefox: Delete cookies to remove data that websites have stored on your computer</a>
<a class="adsimple-221107369" href="https://support.microsoft.com/de-at/help/17442/windows-internet-explorer-delete-manage-cookies?tid=221107369" class="external" rel="nofollow">Internet Explorer: deleting and managing cookies</a>

</p>
<p>If you basically do not want to have cookies, you can set up your browser so that it always informs you when a cookie is to be set. So you can decide with each single cookie whether you allow the cookie or not. The procedure varies depending on the browser. It's best to search Google for "Chrome cookies" or "Disable cookies Chrome" in the case of a Chrome browser.
What about my privacy?</p>
<p>Since 2009 there are the so-called "cookie guidelines". It states that the storage of cookies requires the consent of you. Within the EU countries, however, there are still very different reactions to these guidelines. In Austria, however, the implementation of this directive was carried out in Section 96 (3) of the Telecommunications Act (TKG).
If you want to know more about cookies and do not shy away from technical documentation, we recommend https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265 , the Request for Comments of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) called "HTTP State Management Mechanism".</p>
