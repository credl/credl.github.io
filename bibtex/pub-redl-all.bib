	abstract = {Answer Set Programming is a well-established paradigm of declarative programming in close relationship with other declarative formalisms such as {SAT} Modulo Theories, Constraint Handling Rules, PDDL and many others. Since its first informal editions, {ASP} systems are compared in the nowadays customary {ASP} Competition. The fourth {ASP} Competition, held in 2012/2013, is the sequel to previous editions and it was jointly organized by University of Calabria (Italy) and the Vienna University of Technology (Austria). Participants competed on a selected collection of benchmark problems, taken from a variety of research areas and real world applications. The Competition featured two tracks: the Model& Solve Track, held on an open problem encoding, on an open language basis, and open to any kind of system based on a declarative specification paradigm; and the System Track, held on the basis of fixed, public problem encodings, written in a standard {ASP} language.},

	abstract = {System competitions evaluate solvers and compare state-of-the-art implementations on benchmark sets in a dedicated and controlled computing environment comprising of multiple hosts. An important task for running a competition is the benchmark execution platform that schedules the workload on available benchmark machines, keeps track of failed and finished jobs, and calculates the competition statistics and solver ranking. In this paper we present VCWC, the Versioning Competition Workflow Compiler.  This tool takes as input the participating solvers and dedicated benchmark sets and generates a workflow description for executing all necessary (sub-)tasks for generating the final solver rankings and statistics.  As jobs may fail during the execution, VCWC supports a gradual refinement of the competition workflow and allows to add or update solvers, instances, benchmarks, or further runs after the machinery has been brought up. We introduce an abstract model for a competition and present the implementation and system architecture for VCWC.  Based on this we report how VCWC is used for the Answer Set Programming Competition 2013.

	abstract = {Answer set programs with external source access may introduce new constants that are not present in the program, which is known as value invention. As naive value invention leads to programs with infinite grounding and answer sets, syntactic safety criteria are imposed on programs. However, traditional criteria are in many cases unnecessarily strong and limit expressiveness. We present liberal domain-expansion (de-) safe programs, a novel generic class of answer set programs with external source access that has a finite grounding and allows for value invention. De-safe programs use so-called term bounding functions as a parameter for modular instantiation with concrete---e.g., syntactic or semantic or both---safety criteria. This ensures extensibility of the approach in the future. We provide concrete instances of the framework and develop an operator that can be used for computing a finite grounding. Finally, we discuss related notions of safety from the literature, and show that our approach is strictly more expressive.},

	abstract = {{HEX}-programs are an extension of the Answer Set Programming({ASP}) paradigm incorporating external means of computation into the declarative programming language through so-called external atoms. Their semantics is defined in terms of minimal models of the Faber-Leone-Pfeifer (FLP) reduct. Developing native solvers for {HEX}-programs based on an appropriate notion of unfounded sets has been subject to recent research for reasons of efficiency. Although this has lead to an improvement over naive minimality checking using the FLP reduct, testing for foundedness remains a computationally expensive task. In this work we improve on {HEX}-program evaluation in this respect by identifying a syntactic class of programs, that can be efficiently recognized and allows to entirely skip the foundedness check. Moreover, we develop criteria for decomposing a program into components, such that the search for unfounded sets can be restricted. Observing that our results apply to many {HEX}-program applications provides analytic evidence for the significance and effectiveness of our approach, which is complemented by a brief discussion of preliminary experimental validation.},

	abstract = {Answer-Set Programming ({ASP}) is an established declarative programming paradigm. However, classical {ASP} lacks subprogram calls as in procedural programming, and access to external computations (like remote procedure calls) in general. The feature is desired for increasing modularity and---assuming proper access in place---(meta-)reasoning  over subprogram results.  While {HEX}-programs extend classical {ASP} with external source access, they do not support calls of (sub-)programs upfront. We present nested {HEX}-programs, which extend {HEX}-programs to serve the desired feature, in a user-friendly manner. Notably, the answer sets of called sub-programs can be individually accessed. This is particularly useful for applications that need to reason over answer sets like belief set merging, user-defined aggregate functions, or preferences over answer sets.},

	abstract = {Decision diagrams (DDs) are a popular means for decision making, e.g., in clinical guidelines.  Some applications require to integrate multiple related yet different diagrams into a single one, for which algorithms have been developed. However, existing merging tools are monolithic, application-tailored programs with no clear interface to the actual merging procedures, which makes their reuse hard if not impossible.  We present a general, declarative framework for merging and manipulating decision diagram tasks based on a belief set merging framework. Its modular architecture hides details of the merging algorithm and supports pre- and user-defined merging operators, which can be flexibly arranged in merging plans to express complex merging tasks. Changing and restructuring merging tasks becomes easy, and relieves the user from (repetitive) manual integration to focus on experimenting with different merging strategies, which is vital for applications, as discussed for an example from DNA classification. Our framework supports also reasoning over DDs using answer set programming ({ASP}), which allows to drive the merging process and select results based on the application needs.},

	Abstract = {We present a declarative framework for belief set merging tasks over (possibly heterogeneous) knowledge bases, where belief sets are sets of literals. The framework is designed generically for flexible deployment to a range of applications, and allows to specify complex merging tasks in tree-structured merging plans, whose leaves are the possible belief sets of the knowledge bases that are processed using merging operators.  A prototype is implemented in MELD (MErging Library for Dlvhex) on top of the DLVHEX system for {HEX}-programs, which are nonmonotonic logic programs with access to external sources. Plans in the task description language allow to formulate different conflict resolution strategies, and by shared object libraries, the user may also develop and integrate her own merging operators.  MELD supports rapid prototyping of merging tasks, providing a computational backbone such that users can focus on operator optimization and evaluation, and on experimenting with merging strategies; this is particularly useful if a best merging operator or strategy is not known. Example applications are combining multiple decision diagrams (e.g., in biomedicine), judgment aggregation in social choice theory, and ontology merging.},
